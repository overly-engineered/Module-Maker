Click submit and get started

5
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
At the top is the menu, where you can:

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Go to the homepage

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000

1
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.500
Log out

1
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
See which site you are currently working on

1
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Some sites have more modules than others

1
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Select the site to see available modules

1
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Lets create a new module for Waitrose Cellar

1
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Here is our new card element

1
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Here are the available options for the new card

1
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Here we can change the asset size for the card

1
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In this case we will choose half width

1
00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now we can customise our copy

2
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Not all options are included on the card

2
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You can put html into some of these options, to bold or break text

2
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Remember to close your tags.

2
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Now we will create our new link

2
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:20.000
We need to add all relevent information as the GA tracking is built from this information

2
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We can also change the type of CTA for the new card

2
00:03:35.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Now we can change the CTA text, Link, Link description, and asset destination (used for GA)

2
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We will now add in the new image provided by the design team

2
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Ooops

2
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
There we go

2
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Now we add our image description

3
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Here we can pick from the available roundels for the new card

3
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
There is a dropdown here but it wont show on the screen recorder

3
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
They are the same options as you would normally see, eg: Save upto, Save, Green, Red, Percent off etc.

3
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Once we have selected one we can customises it to our needs.

3
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
We've finished editing now so we can click the create button and get our new module

3
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Tada

3
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000
We can see the output code so we can check for the important bits like GA tags

3
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Be sure to check carefully, we dont want any mistakes. :)

3
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Once we're ready we can click the copy code button to get the code copied to the clipboard.

3
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We can now paste our code straight into management centre.

4
00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:08.000
We can save a module by entering a name for it. Please follow the standard in the help section

4
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Our new card is now saved and can be recalled later.

4
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Thanks for watching, you can find more help in the help centre.
